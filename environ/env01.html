    <h3>Once upon a time, there lived The Guppy. He lived in a beautiful and peaceful pond.</h3>
    <div class="beside">
    <img id="hi" src="Guppy.webp"/>

    <p>
        His friend, a kitty cat, came by to visit. Kitty cat slapped the water. "Knock Knock" <br>
        "Who's there?" Guppy cried out. <br>
      "Meow" <br>
      "Meow who" <br>
      "It's meow or never! Lemme in." Guppy felt a shiver go down his back.
        This is odd, he doesn't have any friends and stays inside all the time. Who could this be?
        Guppy looked through the peephole and there, The Kitty Cat was staring back. <br>
    </div>
     <img id="cat" src="cat-smile.gif"/>

     <br>
    
     Guppy's heart dropped. Cat was much bigger than Guppy was and it's a well known fact that cats enjoy the taste of fish.
